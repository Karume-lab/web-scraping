ETL:
	Extract, Transform, Load Web scraping is one form of ETL:
		you extract data from a website, transform it to fit the format you want, and load it into a CSV file. To extract data from the web, you need to know a few basics about HTML, the backbone of each web page you see on the internet.



TOOLS:
	re => regexs
	beautifulsoup => static sites
	(USE FIRST)requests-html/selenium => non-static sites
	urllib => request site data from a specific site
